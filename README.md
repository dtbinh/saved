Collection of old shareware/software/freestuff (from before ~2005) that I've tried to recover from mainland Chinese websites that rehost source code (like CodeForge and pudn) and demand payment for downloads. 

If you see anything on here that belongs to you, send me a PM and I'll take it down immediately. Repo established to make finding source code that legacy systems might depend on so debugging is less of a hassle.
