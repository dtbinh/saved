# This file affects handling of files based on their names.
#
# The -t/-f options allow one to treat directories of files
# as a single file, or to transform a file in other ways on
# its way in and out of CVS.
#
# The -m option specifies whether CVS attempts to merge files.
#
# The -k option specifies keyword expansion (e.g. -kb for binary).
#
# Format of wrapper file ($CVSROOT/CVSROOT/cvswrappers or .cvswrappers)
#
#  wildcard	[option value][option value]...
#
#  where option is one of
#  -f		from cvs filter		value: path to filter
#  -t		to cvs filter		value: path to filter
#  -m		update methodology	value: MERGE or COPY
#  -k		expansion mode		value: b, o, kkv, &c
#
#  and value is a single-quote delimited value.
# For example:
#*.gif -k 'b'

# windows icon files
*.ico -k 'b'

# Adobe Portable Document Format
*.pdf -k 'b'

# Windows Powerpoint Presentations
*.ppt -k 'b'

# MATLAB linux Mex functions
*.mexglx -k 'b'

# Dynamic shared libraries, windows and linux, respectively.
*.dll -k 'b'
*.so -k 'b'

#=========================================================================
# The following files are not strictly binary, but we would like to avoid 
# translating the EOL for these files.  This simplifies cross-platform
# development by allowing both linux/windoze builds on a smb share
# sandbox.

# Initialization files for AVDS 
*.ini -k 'b'

# Workspace project files for MSVC++
*.dsw -k 'b'
*.dsp -k 'b'
